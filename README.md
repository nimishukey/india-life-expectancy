# india-life-expectancy

Life expectancy is an estimate of how long a person would live, on average.

Life expectancy is affected by many factors such as:
• Socioeconomic status, including employment, income, education and economic wellbeing.
• The quality of the health system and the ability of people to access it; health behaviors such as tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, poor nutrition and lack of exercise.
• Social factors; genetic factors; and environmental factors including overcrowded housing, lack of clean drinking water and adequate sanitation, etc.

With the help of the above-mentioned factors, I tried to analyse t the data and come up with measurable solutions to improve the Life Expectancy.
